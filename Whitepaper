The WHITEPAPER

Muffin community has run lotteries for a long time. It has always been a way to incentivize new members into the group and to give back to the members who have been here supporting the Muffin community from the beginging. These tickets will be sent out to all MUFN PNP hodlers. 1 MUFN + 1 PNP = Lotto Ticket. Or the tickets can be bought directly from the Muffin Baker himself or you can buy them on justswap.io. The max supply of the token is 10,000,0000,000 and there will be burns after each lottery of the tokens issued for that lottery. When users send their tickets in to be burned they will earn OJ rewards proportional to the amount of tickets being burned.

The money raised in the lottery will go directly into the pool for the next lottery. So as our member size grows so will the rewards pool for each lotto.

1 MUFN LOTTO ticket will be given to each member of the community giving them a free chance to win in the first lottery. The lotteries will go until no one joins.
